## 1.1 STATION GEOMETRY & MATERIALS
Station MSD utilizes a **Federation-Cardassian Hybrid Architecture** due to its role as a heavily fortified orbital fortress.

### Physical Dimensions
*   **Diameter (Primary Disc)**: 3,200 meters.
*   **Height (Total)**: 2,450 meters (150 Decks).
*   **Mass**: 125,000,000 metric tonnes (Approx).
*   **Hull Material**: Duranium/Tritanium composite skin with 12cm high-density ablative armor plating.

### Structural Integrity Field (SIF)
The SIF is a subspace field that reinforces the physical hull, allowing it to withstand accelerations and impacts that would normally shatter the duranium frame.
*   **Generators**: 4x Graff-Wang standard field generators located on **Deck 85**.
*   **Conduit Network**: Molybdenum-jacketed waveguide conduits running through all keel structures.
*   **Physics**: The field operates at **144 Hz**. During combat, this is modulated to **256 Hz** to disperse graviton shear.
*   **Failure Consequence**:
    *   **< 75%**: Micro-fractures in transparent aluminum windows.
    *   **< 40%**: Bulkhead deformation; turbolifts jam.
    *   **< 0%**: Immediate structural collapse under own gravity.

## 1.2 MASTER DECK PLAN (1-150)
The station is vertically divided into functional blocks.

| Deck Range | Section Name | Key Facilities | Access Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **001-010** | **Command Spire** | Ops, CO Ready Room, Stellar Cartography | Level 10 |
| **011-030** | **Habitat Ring** | Crew Quarters, Promenade (Deck 21), Infirmary | General |
| **031-080** | **Engineering Disc** | Main Computer Cores, Industrial Replicators | Level 5 |
| **081-085** | **SIF Control** | SIF Generators, IDF Generators | Level 8 |
| **086-120** | **Reactor Core** | M/ARA Injection Assembly, Antimatter Pods | Level 9 |
| **121-140** | **Hangar Bays** | Shuttle Storage, Runabout Pads, Maintenance | Level 4 |
| **141-150** | **Lower Pylon** | Plasma Exhaust, Tractor Emitters, Waste | Level 3 |

### Detailed Highlights
*   **Deck 1 (Ops)**: The nerve center. Contains the Master Situation Monitor (MSM).
*   **Deck 21 (The Promenade)**: The social hub. Contains Replimat, Holosuites 1-6.
*   **Deck 102 (The Core)**: The physical location of the Dilithium Chamber. High radiation hazard.

## 1.3 INERTIAL DAMPING FIELD (IDF)
Located parallel to the SIF network.
*   **Function**: Counteracts linear acceleration force.
*   **Lag**: The System has a **350 millisecond** response lag time. This is why crew members "stumble" when the shields are hit—the IDF hasn't caught up to the kinetic transfer yet.

---

## 1.4 AIRLOCK & DOCKING PORTS
*   **Upper Pylons (1-3)**: Capable of docking Galaxy-class starships.
*   **Umbilical Connectors**: Hard-line EPS and O2 transfer capability for docked vessels.
*   **Emergency Blow-out**: All airlocks are equipped with explosive bolts to jettison a docked ship in case of a warp core breach.
