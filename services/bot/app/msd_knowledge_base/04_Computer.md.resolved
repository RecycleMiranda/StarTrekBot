## 4.1 COMPUTER CORE ARCHITECTURE
MSD utilizes a **Hybridized Bio-Neural / Isolinear Computing** model.

### The Triad System
*   **Core A (Tactical / Ops Tower)**: Dedicated to firing solutions, shield modulation, and real-time combat analysis.
*   **Core B (Habitat / Upper Ring)**: Manages life support, replicator quotas, and environmental regulation.
*   **Core C (Engineering / Reactor)**: Monitors M/ARA intermix ratios and EPS containment.

### Optical Data Network (ODN)
Data travels via coherent photon packets through fiber-optic cables.
*   **Transfer Rate**: 4,500 Teraquads/second.
*   **Vulnerability**: If an ODN junction is severed (physical damage), the affected deck enters "Local Mode" (loss of main computer uplink).

## 4.2 SENSOR PALETTES
Station MSD is the "Eye of Mars".
*   **Lateral Sensors**: Located on the engineering rim. Capable of scanning a shuttle at 3 light-years.
*   **Long-Range Sensors**: Located on the upper spire. Can detect warp signatures in the Alpha Centauri sector.
*   **Internal Sensors**:
    *   **Biometric**: Tracks Combadge signals.
    *   **Transport Lock**: Can lock onto a specific lifeform for beam-out.

## 4.3 SECURITY PROTOCOLS (Intruder Control)
When the computer detects an unauthorized lifeform (e.g., no combadge signal or invalid DNA):

### Level 1-3 (Caution)
*   **Action**: Voice warning ("Unauthorized access").
*   **Restriction**: Lock local door panels.

### Level 4 (Intruder Alert)
*   **Action**: Force Fields erect in the corridor.
*   **Containment**:
    1.  **Anesthezine Gas**: Released from ceiling vents (Sleep agent).
    2.  **Ray Shields**: Lethal force fields (if authorized by Command).

### The "Override Alpha"
The Station Commander (Level 10) possesses an absolute override code that bypasses all computer logic checks.
*   **Code**: `DEST-0-0-1` (Example for Auto-Destruct).

---

## 4.4 COMMUNICATIONS (SUB-SPACE)
*   **Array**: 12 Subspace Transceivers.
*   **Speed**: Signal propagates at Warp 9.9997 equivalent.
*   **Lag**:
    *   Earth: Real-time (0.00s).
    *   Deep Space 9: 4.5 hours delay (requires relay).
